Setting up KAlarm on non-KDE desktops
=====================================

Although KAlarm is a KDE application and requires KDE to be installed on your
system, you can still use it while running other desktops or window managers.

In order to have alarms monitored and displayed automatically from one login
session to the next, KAlarm must be run automatically when you graphically log
in or otherwise start X. If you are running the KDE desktop, the KAlarm
installation process sets this up for you.

If you want to use KAlarm with Gnome or another non-KDE window manager, you
have two alternatives:

1)  If your desktop environment/window manager performs session restoration,
    ensure that the kalarm is included in the session restoration, and that
    after login or restarting X kalarm is running with a '-session' command
    line option, e.g.

        kalarm -session 117f000002000100176495700000008340018

    You can use the 'ps' command to check this.

2)  If you cannot use session restoration to start KAlarm correctly, you
    must configure the following command to be run whenever you graphically log
    in or start X:

        kalarm --tray

    If you have successfully configured session restoration, you should also
    configure the following command to be run whenever you graphically log in
    or start X:

        kalarmautostart kalarm --tray

    If your desktop environment or window manager has a facility to configure
    programs to be run at login, you can use that facility. Otherwise, you need
    to add the command to an appropriate script which is run after X is started.


If you can send me details on how to set up KAlarm for any particular window
manager, I will include these in the next version of KAlarm.
