KAlarm

Setting up on non-KDE desktops
==============================

Although KAlarm is a KDE application and requires KDE to be installed on your
system, you can still use it while running other desktops or window managers.

In order to have alarms monitored and displayed automatically from one login
session to the next, the alarm daemon (which monitors the alarm list and tells
KAlarm to display each alarm when it becomes due) must be run automatically
when you graphically login or otherwise start X. If you are running the KDE
desktop, the KAlarm installation process sets this up for you.

If you want to use KAlarm with Gnome or another non-KDE window manager, you
have two alternatives:

1) If your desktop environment/window manager performs session restoration,
ensure that the alarm daemon (kalarmd) is included in the session restoration,
and that after login or restarting X the alarm daemon is running with a
'-session' command line option, e.g.

    kalarmd -session 117f000002000100176495700000008340018

You can use the 'ps' command to check this.

2) If you cannot use session restoration to start the alarm daemon correctly,
you must configure the following command to be run whenever you graphically log
in or start X:

    kalarmd --login

If your desktop environment or window manager has a facility to configure
programs to be run at login, you can use that facility. Otherwise, you need to
add the command to an appropriate script which is run after X is started.

If you can specify an order to start the applications, start kalarm first, then
kalarmd.


If you can send me details on how to set up the daemon for any particular
window manager, I will include these in the next version of KAlarm.
