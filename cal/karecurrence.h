/**
 * @short Represents recurrences for KAlarm.
 *
 * This class represents the restricted range of recurrence types which are
 * handled by KAlarm, and translates between these and the libkcalcore
 * Recurrence class. In particular, it handles yearly recurrences on 29th
 * February in non-leap years specially:
 *
 * KARecurrence allows annual 29th February recurrences to fall on 28th
 * February or 1st March, or not at all, in non-leap years. It allows such
 * 29th February recurrences to be combined with the 29th of other months in
 * a simple way, represented simply as the 29th of multiple months including
 * February. For storage in the libkcalcore calendar, the 29th day of the month
 * recurrence for other months is combined with a last-day-of-February or a
 * 60th-day-of-the-year recurrence rule, thereby conforming to RFC2445.
