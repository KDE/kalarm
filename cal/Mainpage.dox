/*!
 * @mainpage The KAlarm client library
 *
 * @section purpose Purpose
 *
 * This library provides access to and handling of KAlarm calendar data.
 *
 * @section desc Description
 *
 * This library provides access to KAlarm calendar data, but not to the storage
 * of the data, which is handled by Akonadi (or by build option, KResources).
 * The main class, KAEvent represents a KAlarm event, and contains both the
 * event definition including the main alarm and optional subsidiary alarms, and
 * status information about the event.
 *
 * Calendar format information is accessed through the KACalendar class, which
 * provides read and write access to the calendar format version and
 * iCalendar product ID.
 *
 * Recurrence and sub-repetition information is represented by the KARecurrence
 * and Repetition classes respectively. The DateTime class is similar to
 * KDateTime but with a configurable start-of-day time for date-only times.
 *
 * Three Akonadi attributes, for Collections and Items, are provided by
 * CollectionAttribute, CompatibilityAttribute and EventAttribute classes.
