KAlarm

KAlarm lets you set up personal alarm messages, emails and commands via a
graphical interface. The messages pop up on the screen, or the emails or
commands execute, at the time you specify.

When setting up or modifying an alarm, the options available let you:
 * choose whether the alarm should display a text message, display a text file,
   execute a command, or send an email.
 * configure the alarm to recur on an hours/minutes, daily, weekly, monthly or
   annual basis, or set it to trigger every time you log in.
 * choose a colour for displaying the alarm message.
 * specify an audible beep or a sound file to play when the message is
   displayed.
 * choose whether or not the alarm should be canceled if it can't be triggered
   at its scheduled time. An alarm can only be triggered while you are logged
   in and running a graphical environment. If you choose not to cancel the
   alarm if it can't be triggered at the correct time, it will be triggered
   when you eventually log in.

Alarms may also be scheduled from the command line, or via DCOP calls from
other programs.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
