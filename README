KAlarm
======

KAlarm is a personal alarm message, audio, command and email scheduler.

KAlarm provides a graphical interface to schedule personal timed events -
pop-up alarm messages, playing audio files, command execution and the sending
of emails. It has a wide range of options, including:

 * Configuring alarms to recur on an hours/minutes, daily, weekly, monthly or
   annual basis, or setting them to trigger every time you log in.

 * Choice of whether or not an alarm should be cancelled if it can't be
   triggered at its scheduled time. An alarm can only be triggered while you
   are logged in and running a graphical environment. If you choose not to
   cancel the alarm if it can't be triggered at the correct time, it will be
   triggered when you eventually log in.

Options for pop-up alarms include:

 * Speaking the message.

 * Playing a sound file when the alarm is displayed.

 * Setting a reminder to be displayed in advance of, or after, the main alarm
   time(s).

 * Selection of the alarm message's colour and font.

In addition to its graphical mode, alarms may also be scheduled from the
command line, or via D-Bus calls from other programs.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
