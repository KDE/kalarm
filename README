KAlarm

Version 0.3.5

KAlarm provides a graphical interface for setting up personal alarm/reminder
messages. The messages pop up on the screen at the time you specify.

KAlarm also provides a command line interface. Other programs can also use
DCOP calls to execute functions.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

BUGS:

Bugs can be reported to the KDE bug tracking system (http://bugs.kde.org).
There you can also get information about the status of older bugs.
KAlarm, as most other KDE 2 programs, offers a menu item "Report Bug"
in the Help menu for convenient reporting of bugs or feature requests.
