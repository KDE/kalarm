KAlarm

KAlarm is a personal alarm message, command and email scheduler. It lets you
set up personal alarm messages which pop up on the screen at the chosen time,
or you can schedule commands to be executed or emails to be sent.

When setting up or modifying an alarm, the options available let you:
 * choose whether the alarm should display a text message, display a text file,
   execute a command, or send an email.
 * configure the alarm to recur on an hours/minutes, daily, weekly, monthly or
   annual basis, or set it to trigger every time you log in.
 * specify that a reminder should be displayed in advance of the main alarm
   time(s).
 * choose a colour and font for displaying the alarm message.
 * specify an audible beep or a sound file to play when the message is
   displayed.
 * choose whether or not the alarm should be cancelled if it can't be triggered
   at its scheduled time. An alarm can only be triggered while you are logged
   in and running a graphical environment. If you choose not to cancel the
   alarm if it can't be triggered at the correct time, it will be triggered
   when you eventually log in.

In addition to its graphical mode, alarms may also be scheduled from the
command line, or via DCOP calls from other programs.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
