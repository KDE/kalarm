====================

The following bugs are known to exist in KAlarm:

-- Bug 79247: Summer/winter time changes (daylight savings time changes), are
   not handled well. KAlarm needs to use time zones in scheduling alarms instead
   of a simple local time which it currently uses. This requires improved
   timezone handling in kdelibs and libkcal.
