Known bugs in KAlarm
====================

The following bugs are known to exist in KAlarm:

-- Bug 79247: Summer/winter time changes (daylight savings time changes), are
   not handled well. KAlarm needs to use time zones in scheduling alarms instead
   of a simple local time which it currently uses. This requires improved
   timezone handling in kdelibs and libkcal. This is fixed in KAlarm version 1.9.

The following bugs appear to be KAlarm bugs but are actually due to other software:

-- System tray icon has an opaque background (KDE bug 122988)
   In the system tray, the KAlarm icon sometimes does not have a transparent
   background, but instead displays inside an opaque square set to the KDE window
   background colour. This is due to a bug in the QtCurve style, and can be fixed
   by choosing a different style.
