/**
 *  @short Radio button with associated file picker controls.
 *
 *  The PickFileRadio class is a radio button with an associated button to choose
 *  a file, and an optional file name edit box. Its purpose is to ensure that while
 *  the radio button is selected, the chosen file name is never blank.
 *
 *  To achieve this, whenever the button is newly selected and the
 *  file name is currently blank, the file picker dialog is displayed to choose a
 *  file. If the dialog exits without a file being chosen, the radio button selection
 *  is reverted to the previously selected button in the parent button group.
 *
 *  The class handles the activation of the file picker dialog (via a virtual method
 *  which must be supplied by deriving a class from this one). It also handles all
 *  enabling and disabling of the browse button and edit box when the enable state of
 *  the radio button is changed, and when the radio button selection changes.
