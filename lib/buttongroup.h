/**
 *  @short A QButtonGroup with signal on new selection, plus Qt 2 compatibility.
 *
 *  The ButtonGroup class provides an enhanced version of the QButtonGroup class.
 *
 *  It emits an additional signal, buttonSet(int), whenever any of its buttons
 *  changes state, for whatever reason, including programmatic control. (The
 *  QButtonGroup class only emits signals when buttons are clicked on by the user.)
 *  The class also provides Qt 2 compatibility.
