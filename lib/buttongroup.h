 *  @short A QButtonGroup with signal on new selection, and button IDs.
 *
 *  The ButtonGroup class provides an enhanced version of the QButtonGroup class.
 *
 *  It emits an additional signal, buttonSet(QAbstractButton*), whenever any of its
 *  buttons changes state, for whatever reason, including programmatic control. (The
 *  QButtonGroup class only emits signals when buttons are clicked on by the user.)
 *
 *  It allows buttons to have associated ID numbers, which can be used to access the
 *  buttons.
