 *  The Label class provides a text display, with special behaviour when a radio
 *  button is set as a buddy.
 *
 *  The Label object in effect acts as if it were part of the buddy radio button,
 *  in that when the label's accelerator key is pressed, the radio button receives
 *  focus and is switched on. When a non-radio button is specified as a buddy, the
 *  behaviour is the same as for QLabel.
