/**
 *  @short Enhanced KProcess to run a shell command.
 *
 *  The ShellProcess class runs a shell command and interprets the shell exit status
 *  as far as possible. It blocks execution if shell access is prohibited. It buffers
 *  data written to the process's stdin.
 *
 *  Before executing any command, ShellProcess checks whether shell commands are
 *  allowed at all. If not (e.g. if the user is running in kiosk mode), it blocks
 *  execution.
 *
 *  Derived from KProcess, this class additionally tries to interpret the shell
 *  exit status. Different shells use different exit codes. Currently, if bash or ksh
 *  report that the command could not be found or could not be executed, the NOT_FOUND
 *  status is returned.
 *
 *  Writes to the process's stdin are buffered, so that unlike with KProcess, there
 *  is no need to wait for the write to complete before writing again.
