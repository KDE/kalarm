/**
 *  @short Time period entry widget.
 *
 *  The TimePeriod class provides a widget for entering a time period as a number of
 *  weeks, days, hours and minutes, or minutes.
 *
 *  It displays a combo box to select the time units (weeks, days, hours and minutes, or
 *  minutes) alongside a spin box to enter the number of units. The type of spin box
 *  displayed alters according to the units selection: day, week and minute values are
 *  entered in a normal spin box, while hours and minutes are entered in a time spin box
 *  (with two pairs of spin buttons, one for hours and one for minutes).
 *
 *  The widget may be set as read-only. This has the same effect as disabling it, except
 *  that its appearance is unchanged.
