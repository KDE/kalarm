/**
 *  @short A QCheckBox with focus widget and read-only options.
 *
 *  The CheckBox class is a QCheckBox with the ability to transfer focus to another
 *  widget when checked, and with a read-only option.
 *
 *  Another widget may be specified as the focus widget for the check box. Whenever
 *  the user clicks on the check box so as to set its state to checked, focus is
 *  automatically transferred to the focus widget.
 *
 *  The widget may be set as read-only. This has the same effect as disabling it, except
 *  that its appearance is unchanged.
