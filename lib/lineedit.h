/**
 *  @short Line edit widget with extra drag and drop options.
 *
 *  The LineEdit class is a line edit widget which accepts specified types of drag and
 *  drop content.
 *
 *  The widget will always accept drag and drop of text, except text/calendar mime type,
 *  and of URLs. It will accept additional mime types depending on its configuration:
 *  Text type accepts email address lists.
 *  Email type accepts email address lists and VCard data (e.g. from KAddressBook). 
 *
 *  The class also provides an option to prevent its contents being selected when the
 *  widget receives focus.
